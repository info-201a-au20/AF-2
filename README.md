# Domain of Interest

## The 2020 Presidential Election
The 2020 Presidential Election has been happening for the past week, so due to its relevancy and 
historical significance, we decided to use it as our domain of interest. With parties being more 
polarized than ever, the politicization of the COVID pandemic, and a historic voter turnout, all of 
these are culminating to one of the most important elections in our time. And working with recent 
data will be both pretty simple to find, and make us more informed about current events.

## Data Driven Projects Related to the Domain
### Exit Polls
[Exit polls](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/exit-polls-president.html) are a necessity in predicting the outcome of an election on election night. These polls collect information on how people voted, their demographics, and is used by media organizations as a news peg for election coverage.
### U.S. Census
The U.S. [Census](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219)  Bureau collects basic information about the people who live in the United States. These questions include topics such as demographics, and household size.
### Covid-19 Tracking 
[COVID-19](https://covidtracking.com/data/national) has been at the forefront of this election, and data about the number of infections, recoveries, and deaths has been tracked since the pandemic’s beginning. Data projects like the COVID Tracking Project have been providing daily statistics about the virus’s spread.
### Voter Turnout
[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/elections/voter-turnout/) uses a combination of both their own modeling and Edison Research’s modeling to provide insight on this election’s predicted voter turnout. This project anticipates the highest voter turnout since 1900.


## Data Driven Question Related to the Domain
### Question : 
How much was the result of the 2020 election different from the predicted odds?
- We can compare actual voting results with pre-election polling data to see the difference.

### Question : 
What correlation does voter turnout percentages have on the difference between predicted odds and actual votes?
- We can test to see if there is an association between voter turnout and the differentiation of predicted odds and actual votes by looking at voter turnout percentages and the difference, and seeing if there is a correlation. If they are correlated they could be either positively associated or negatively associated. 

### Question : 
What does age and race have to do with the voter turnout of the presidential election?
- Using collected data of voter turnout, we can analyze the demographics of that turnout to see what demographics are most present in voter turnout, and which are least present.
