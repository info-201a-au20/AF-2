## The 2020 Presidential Election

The 2020 Presidential Election has been happening for the past week, so due to its relevancy and 
historical significance, we decided to use it as our domain of interest. With parties being more 
polarized than ever, the politicization of the COVID pandemic, and a historic voter turnout, all of 
these are culminating to one of the most important elections in our time. And working with recent 
data will be both pretty simple to find, and make us more informed about current events.

### Exit Polls
[Exit polls](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/exit-polls-president.html) are a necessity in predicting the outcome of an election on election night. These polls collect information on how people voted, their demographics, and is used by news organizations to give election coverage.
